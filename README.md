# Face Detection Project with YOLOv8

A Python project leveraging the cutting-edge YOLOv8 model for efficient and accurate face detection in images and video streams.

## High-Level Design

The core process for face detection with YOLOv8 involves the following steps:

    style G fill:#D1ECF1,stroke:#17A2B8,stroke-width:2px;
```

### Process Flow
1.  **Input Acquisition:** Capture or load an image or video frame.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Prepare the input data to match the model's requirements.
3.  **Model Inference:** The YOLOv8 model analyzes the preprocessed data to identify potential faces.
4.  **Post-processing:** Refine raw detections by removing redundant bounding boxes.
5.  **Output Generation:** Display or save the processed image/video with detected faces highlighted.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1.  **Object Detection Model**
    * `ultralytics` (YOLOv8 framework):
        * **Rationale:** YOLOv8 is chosen for its state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection, offering an excellent balance between speed and accuracy. The `ultralytics` library provides a streamlined API for model loading, inference, and visualization, making development efficient.
2.  **Image & Video Processing**
    * `opencv-python` (`cv2`):
        * **Rationale:** OpenCV is the industry standard for computer vision tasks in Python. It's used for reading/writing image and video files, handling image manipulation (resizing, color conversion), and drawing bounding boxes for visualization.
3.  **Numerical Operations**
    * `numpy`:
        * **Rationale:** Essential for efficient numerical operations on arrays, particularly for handling image data and the numerical outputs from the YOLOv8 model.
4.  **Visualization (within Jupyter)**
    * `matplotlib` (or `IPython.display`):
        * **Rationale:** Used for displaying images and plots directly within the Jupyter Notebook environment, facilitating immediate visualization of detection results.
5.  **Deep Learning Backend**
    * `torch` (PyTorch):
        * **Rationale:** YOLOv8 models are built and optimized using the PyTorch deep learning framework, providing the underlying computational graph and tensor operations.

## Steps to Build and Test

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure `Face_Detection.ipynb` is in your working directory:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with your actual repo URL
    cd <repository-name>       # Replace <repository-name>
    ```
    *(If you just have the `.ipynb` file, skip cloning and make sure you're in the directory where it's located.)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended to manage dependencies):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib
    # If you intend to use a GPU, ensure you install the correct PyTorch version:
    # pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118) # Example for CUDA 11.8
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  **Ensure you have a YOLOv8 pre-trained model:**
    * The `ultralytics` library often downloads the model weights automatically on first use. If not, make sure you've downloaded a `.pt` file (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`, `yolov8s.pt`) and placed it where your notebook expects it, or specify the model name directly (e.g., `model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')`).

2.  **Prepare Input Data:**
    * Place any sample images (e.g., `image.jpg`) or videos (e.g., `video.mp4`) you wish to test in a designated `data/images/` or `data/videos/` folder, or update the paths in the notebook accordingly.

3.  **Execute the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from your terminal in the project directory:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook Face_Detection.ipynb
        ```
    * Once Jupyter opens in your web browser, click on `Face_Detection.ipynb` to open it.
    * Run all cells in the notebook (`Cell > Run All`) to execute the face detection process and view the results.

### Testing

* **Sample Image/Video Test:**
    * The notebook typically includes cells for performing detection on pre-defined sample images or video files.
    * Verify that bounding boxes are drawn accurately around faces and that the confidence scores are reasonable.
* **Webcam Test (if implemented):**
    * If your notebook has code for real-time webcam detection, ensure your webcam is connected and accessible. Run the relevant cell and observe the live detections.
* **Expected Output:**
    * You should see output images/frames with red (or specified color) bounding boxes drawn around detected faces.
    * Confidence scores might be displayed next to each bounding box.
    * For video streams, expect real-time detection and visualization.

## Usage

To use this face detection tool, follow the "Steps to Build and Test" section to set up your environment and run the `Face_Detection.ipynb` notebook. You can modify the input paths within the notebook to test with your own images or videos.

*(You can add specific command-line usage examples here if your notebook has a corresponding `.py` script that can be run directly, e.g.:)*
```bash
# Example if you have a separate Python script (e.g., detect.py)
python detect.py --source "path/to/your/image.jpg" --model "yolov8n.pt"
python detect.py --source "webcam"
```
